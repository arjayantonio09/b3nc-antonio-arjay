### Introduction to HTML
Whew! I can't believe we're done with HTML. It's good to have exercises at the end of each topic to apply what we've learned and test our knowledge if we are able to learn something. Looking forward for more exercises.

### Introduction to CSS
I like Sir Billy's way of teaching that he does not only discuss the topic one straight at a time but he makes practical examples and discuss the concepts and principles simultaneously. It has helped me to learn and appreciate what CSS is all about and how it works.
